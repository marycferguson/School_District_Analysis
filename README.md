  - SCHOOL SUMMMARY
    - Below are the images of the school summary results in the module and challenge. The school summary is not affected until the new test score      percentages are manually added into the summary. Once this has been completed, Thomas High School's (THS) standing in relation to the other high schools improves.

    - Almost all of the score percentages were improved once the THS scores were amended as there are only 15 schools in the analysis, this is expected. 

  - SCORES BY SCHOOL SIZE
    - The middle-sized schools performance is decreased by the change in THS scores and the small-sized school scores are improved by the change in THS data.

  2. The change in THS data improved THS's ranking to be the second best performing schol in the district. 
  3. The change in THS data had the least impact on the 'spending by test score' analysis.
  4. The change in THS data created the most change in middle-sized schools.
